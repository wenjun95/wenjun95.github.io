### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University, under the supervision of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I am also working with Prof. [Tian He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hc1m_BQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Prof. [Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm) and Prof. [Shuai Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0107/c23024a257643/page.htm) in research. I obtained my master degree from Central South University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiawei Huang](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/jiaweihuang/zh_CN/index/27174/list/index.htm).


My research is concentrated in the areas of **Human-Centric Cyber-Physical Systems** and **Spatial-Temporal Data Science**.
I focus on exploring various techniques, e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), Robust Machine Learning, and Interpretable Large-scale System Optimization, for predictive analytics and decision-making problems in smart cities.
My work is informed by real-world demands and the systems I developed have been deployed **nationwide** to improve urban life and promote environmental sustainability.
My publications can also be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_LMyrNQAAAAJ&hl=en).
