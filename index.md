### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University, under the supervision of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I am also working with Prof. [Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm) in research. I obtained my master degree from Central South University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiawei Huang](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/jiaweihuang/zh_CN/index/27174/list/index.htm).


My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Cyber-Physical Systems**, **Data Center Networks**, and **Distributed Machine Learning Systems**. Currently, I focus on **Data-Driven Applications** in **Smart Logistics**.<br>You can contact me at wenjun.lyu AT rutgers DOT edu.

> **Research Intern in JD Logistics    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Mar. 2021 - Aug. 2021, Jun. 2022-Now**
 * Design a homogeneous order grouping system to improve couriers’ workload measurement in last-mile delivery based on couriers’ reporting data, which has been deployed on a nationwide scale.
 * Propose a relay-based last-mile delivery scheme to improve delivery efficiency and design a relay route generation algorithm based on fined-grained courier mobility features, which has been deployed in more than 100 delivery stations.
 * Design a truck scheduling system for transporting orders from the transfer center to multiple delivery stations with the goal of minimizing the average order delivery time.
 * Design a workload-aware task assignment system in last-mile delivery to assign delivery tasks to couriers with the goal of achieving fairness among couriers from the energy consumption perspective.
 * Design a heterogeneous task assignment system in last-mile delivery to assign delivery tasks, customer expansion tasks, and real-time pick-up tasks to couriers to maximize the platform’s revenue.
